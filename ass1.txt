ASSIGNMENT  NO: 1

1.Find out given no is Amrstrong Or Not
Step 1:  Start
Step 2:  Accept number i.e Num
Step 3:  initilize sum=0
Step 4:  Assign No value to Temp i.e temp=num
Step 5:  rem=Num%10
         sum=sum+rem*rem*rem
          Num=Num/10	
Step 6:  while(Num>0) then goto  step5
          otherwise go to Step7
Step 7 :  if(sum==temp)then display Number is amstrong number otherwise go to 9
Step 8:  stop
Step 9:  Display display Number is not amstrong number.
Step 10:  stop




2..Find  out  all  the  Amrstrong  number falling in the range of 100-999 
Step1:    Start
Step 2:   Accept the number from 100
Step 3:   set i=100 to  
           i<999
           num=i
Step 4:   temp=num
Step 5:   while(num>0)
                  initializ sum=0
                  rem=num%10
                  num=num/10
                  sum=sum+rem*rem*rem
Step 6:   if(sum==temp)then display Number is amstrong number 
          otherwise Display display Number is not amstrong number 
Step7:i++ 
Step8:stop






3.Find out simple as well as compund interest of supplied values

Step 1:  start
Step 2:  Accept the Suplied values(Accept the Principle,rate and time)
Step 3:   calculate SI=(principle*rate*time)/100
Step 40:  print SI
Step 5:  calculate CI=principle*math.pow(1+r*0.01,t)-p
Step 6:  print CI





4.supply marks of three subjects and declare the result,result declaration in based below condition:
condition1:all subjects marks is greater than 60 is passed
condition2:any two subject marked are greater than 60 promoted
Condition 3: any one subject marked are greater than 60 or less subject less than 60 is failed
ANS:
Step1: Start
 Step2: Input subjects a,b and c
 Step3: if( a&&b&&c >60)
                  Then print Passed
                Else if(a&&b||c >60)
                   Then print Promoted
                Else 
                   Then print Failed 
Step4: Stop




Q5.Calculate the income tax

Step 1:    Start
Step 2:    enter input CTC
Step 3:    if(CTC<=180000 )
              Then print taxed amount:0
Step 4:    if(CTC>181000&& CTC <300001)
                 Then print taxed amount: CTC*0.1
Step  5:   if(CTC>300000&&CTC<500001)
                Then print taxed amount: CTC*0.2
Step  6:  if (CTC >500000&&CTC<1000001)
                 Then print taxed amount:CTC*0.3
Step 7:    Stop



6.Consider UI based application where you are asking a user to enter his login name and password,after entering the valid user-id and password it will be print the message “welcome”along with username.as per the validation is concered,the program should keep a track login attempts.after three attempts  message should flashed saying contact admin and the program should be terminate
Step1:start
Step 2 : Input username & password.
Step 3 : Retry =0;

Step 4 : check username & password

Step 5 : If username = existing username & password = existing password

Step 6 : Print “welcome & username”

Step 7 : else
                   Retry ++
Step 8 : Follow the step 2 again.

Step 9 : If Retry =3;

               Print “ Contact Admin”.

Step 10 : Stop.




7.there is an array is size of 15 which may or may not be sorted you should write a program to accept no and search it if it contain in array or not
Step 1:  Accept Array
Step 2  :Display Array
Step 3:  Enter the element you want to search in array i.e key
Step 4:  set boolean  flag=false(if flag is flag in our array element is not present)
Step 5:  use for Loop for each element
               if  arr[index]==key
               then set flag==true
               end for loop
Step 6:   if flag==true print that element
Step 7:   else print element not found




Q8: Apply Sorting using Bubble Sort

Step 1:   Begin
Step 2:   Input a[15]
Step 3:   Set i=13
Step 4:   Repeat Step 4to 9 while (i >= 0)
Step 5:   Set j=0
Step 6:   Repeat Step 7 and 8 white (j<= i)
Step 7:   if a[i]> a[j+1] then
              Set temp = a[j]
              A[j] =a[j+1]
              A[j+1] = temp
Step 8:   j = j+1
Step 9:   i= i-1
Step 10:  print a[15]
Step 11:  exit




Q9.Accept the marks of three students for subject say A,B,C find the total scored and the average and the average in all subjects,also findbthe total and average scored by student in each respective subject.

ANS:
Step1:     Start

Step 2:    Accept the three subject marks for each student
Step 3:     Set sub= 3  
Step 4:     Sum of subject=  A+B+C
Step 5:     Avrage = Sum of subject / sub

Step 6:.    Set std = 3 
Step 7:.    Sum of Sub A=A+A+A
Step 8:     Avrage =Sum of Sub A/std

Step 9:     Sum of Sub B=B+B+B
Step 10:   Avrage =Sum of Sub B/std

Step 11:   Sum of Sub C=C+C+C2
Step 12:   Avrage =Sum of Sub C/std
Step 13:   End
